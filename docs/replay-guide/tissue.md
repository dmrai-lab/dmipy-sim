# The tissue

A `Tissue` is what the water is made of: the numbers a replay applies to the pack's channels. It is not a
substrate and not a pack; the pack is the structure, the tissue is the material on it.

```python
from dmipy_sim.spec.tissue import Tissue
wm = Tissue(T2={"intra": 0.05, "extra": 0.055}, T1={"intra": 1.2, "extra": 1.0}, rho=1.16e-6, chi_iso=-1e-7, chi_aniso=-1e-7)
print(wm)
```

| field | unit | what it switches on | needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `T2`, `T1` | s, per pool | the bulk relaxation tier: a weight per walker from its transverse and longitudinal exposure in each pool | the occupancy channel (C1) |
| `rho` | m/s | the surface tier: a weight from the walker's gated wall contact, at the rate `rho / D` | the contact channel (C2) |
| `D` | m²/s | the diffusivity `rho` is scaled by; the walk's own when None | — |
| `chi_iso`, `chi_aniso` | dimensionless | the field tier: a phase from the field source's susceptibility, at the scanner's field | the path channel (C3) and a [scanner](scanner.md) |

Every field is optional and `None` switches its tier off. Per-pool values are a dict by the spec's pool names, a
list by pool id, or one value for every pool.

## The three ways to a tissue

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack

walk = d.simulate_trajectories(300, 2e-9, d.Cylinder(2e-6, (0, 0, 1)), 0.01, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/cylinder", K=8, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")
seq = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[0.0], TE=0.006, slew_rate=np.inf)   # a b = 0: the relaxation alone

S_bare = pack.replay(seq)                                     # 1. none: bare diffusion, the default
S_nom = pack.replay(seq, tissue=pack.nominal)                 # 2. the pack's own: the spec's values, as published
S_mine = pack.replay(seq, tissue=Tissue(T2=0.05))             # 3. yours: one value for every pool here
print(float(S_bare[0]), float(S_nom[0]) <= 1.0, float(S_mine[0]))
print(np.isclose(S_mine[0], np.exp(-0.006 / 0.05)))          # a b = 0 at TE with one T2 is exp(-TE / T2), to rounding
```

`pack.nominal` is the spec's material, and `.replace` changes one value of it while keeping the rest:

```python
warmer = pack.nominal.replace(T2=0.08)
print(warmer.T2, warmer.rho == pack.nominal.rho)
```

## The catalogue

`dmipy_sim.substrate.biophysical_constants` carries cited values by field strength; `canonical_white_matter(field_T)`
returns them as a dict, from which a tissue is one line. In a [study](replay.md) a tissue may be given as a
callable of the scanner, so "white matter at whatever field the scanner has" is stated once and resolved per pair.

```python
from dmipy_sim.substrate.biophysical_constants import canonical_white_matter
def white_matter(scanner):
    B = 3.0 if scanner is None else float(scanner)
    c = canonical_white_matter(field_T=B)
    return Tissue(T2={"intra": c["T2_intra"], "extra": c["T2_extra"]}, rho=c["rho2"], chi_iso=c["chi_iso_myelin"], chi_aniso=c["delta_chi_a"])
print(white_matter(3.0).T2, white_matter(7.0).T2)
```

## What is refused

A tier asked for that the pack does not carry raises, and so does a scanner paired with a tissue that has no
susceptibility in a [study](replay.md); the alternative in each case would be a plausible wrong number.

```python
from dmipy_sim.replay.study import Protocol, Study
try:
    pack.study(Study(Protocol([seq]), tissues=[Tissue(T2=0.05)], scanners=[3.0]))   # a field on a tissue without chi
except ValueError as e:
    print("refused:", str(e)[:60])
try:
    pack.replay(seq, tissue="white matter")                   # a string is not a tissue
except TypeError as e:
    print("refused:", str(e)[:40])
```
