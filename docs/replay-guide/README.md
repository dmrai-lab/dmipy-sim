# The replay guide

How a walk stored once becomes any acquisition on any tissue on any scanner: the objects, what each one touches,
and the operations that join them. Every code block on these pages runs in the test suite
(`tests/test_replay_guide.py`), so a block that no longer runs is a page that fails.

## The objects, and what each one is

| object | what it is | where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| **pack** (`ReplayPack`) | the sample's structure, walked once and stored: per-walker positions as bridge bands, the pool a walker is in, its wall contact, the field along its path, and the substrate spec it was walked from | `ReplayPack.load(".rpk")`, `ReplayPack.open("hf://...")`, `build_replay_pack(walk)` |
| **sequence** (`ScannerSequence`) | what the scanner plays from t = 0 to the readout: gradients, RF, timing | `sequences.pgse(...)`, `ogse`, `pgste`, `cpmg`, `gre`, `from_waveform` |
| **tissue** (`Tissue`) | what the water is made of: T2 and T1 per pool, the walls' relaxivity, the bulk diffusivity, the field source's susceptibility | `Tissue(...)`, `pack.nominal`, the catalogue |
| **scanner** | what measures it: the static field, the limits | a field in tesla, `ScannerLimits.of("prisma")`, `pack.nominal_field_T` |
| **orientation** | the substrate's pose in the bore | a rotation, or the lab direction the substrate axis points along |
| **study** (`Study`) | a protocol on some tissues on some scanners, replayed in one pass | `Study(Protocol([...]), tissues=[...], scanners=[...])` |

## What this guide is not

It is organised by OBJECT, which makes it a reference you can read in order rather than a cookbook. Three
things it does not cover, so you know to look elsewhere:

* **producing** a pack. The pack page builds one as a prop; the real path is a spec, `walk_spec`, and
  `build_replay_pack`, and its cost model is the fill (`dmipy_sim/fill/`).
* **extending** anything -- a sequence family, a scanner, a channel. Those are the engine's own contracts;
  the geometry one is written out in `CLAUDE.md` and the others are not yet (dmipy-sim#315).
* **troubleshooting**. Every refusal in this library names what it could not do; none of them are collected
  here.

## The knobs, and what each one touches

A replay is a contraction of the pack's stored channels against what the knobs ask for. The table is the spine of
this guide: which object carries a knob, what it touches in the contraction, what happens when it is not given,
where its nominal value lives, and which channel of the pack it needs.

| knob | object | touches | not given | nominal | needs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gradients, RF, timing | sequence | the bands (the gradient phase of every walker) and the coherence gate | required | — | positions (C0) |
| `orientation` | replay call / `Acquisition` | rotates the waveform into the pack's frame, and the field direction with it | the pack's own frame | — | C0 (C3 for the field) |
| `T2`, `T1` per pool | tissue | a weight per walker from its transverse and longitudinal exposure in each pool | no relaxation | `pack.nominal` | occupancy (C1) |
| `rho` | tissue | a weight per walker from its gated wall contact, scaled by `D` | no surface relaxation | `pack.nominal` | contact (C2) |
| `D` | tissue | the diffusivity the pack is READ at: the save grid divided by `D / D_walk`, every channel following in its own space (faster than walked only); `rho` is scaled by it | the walk's | the walk's | — |
| `kappa` | tissue | the wall permeability the pack is read at, which picks the same ratio: a walk serves `(a D_walk, a kappa_walk)` and no other pair | the walk's | the walk's | a permeable wall |
| `chi_iso`, `chi_aniso` | tissue | a phase per walker, linear in the scanner's field | no field | `pack.nominal` | path (C3) |
| field strength | scanner | the same phase, linear in `B0` | no field | `pack.nominal_field_T` | path (C3) |
| `compartment` | replay call | restricts the ensemble mean to one pool | every pool | — | C1 |

Three rules follow from the table and hold everywhere:

1. **Nothing is applied silently.** The default replay is bare diffusion. A pack carries its nominal values as
   `pack.nominal`, and they are one explicit argument away, never the default.
2. **A tier that is asked for and not carried raises.** A T2 on a pack without the occupancy channel, a field on
   a pack without the path channel: an error, not a plausible wrong number.
3. **The sequence and the pose set the contraction; the tissue and the scanner are arithmetic on it.** That is
   what makes a study one pass over the rows for every tissue and scanner it names.

## Publishing a pack

There is one way to build a pack (`build_replay_pack`) and one way to put it on a hub and get it back: `publish`
uploads the file with the dataset's `manifest.json` (one row per pack: its sha256, size, walk and codec
parameters, fidelity, code commit, license, citation) and the card `README.md` rendered from that manifest, in
one commit, and `ReplayPack.load("hf://owner/name/path.rpk")` fetches it and checks the sha256 against the
manifest. Which dataset is the hub is the publisher's business: `repo` is `owner/name`. A pack without an `id`,
`license`, `citation` or `fidelity` is refused.

```bash
python -m dmipy_sim.replay.publish my_pack.rpk --repo owner/name        # prints hf://owner/name/packs/<id>.rpk
```

```python
# docs: skip -- the hub, over the network
uri = pack.publish("owner/name")                     # or publish(path, "owner/name", hub=...) from dmipy_sim.replay.publish
same = ReplayPack.load(uri)                          # fetched into the cache, sha256 checked against the manifest
```

## Reading order

Start with [pack](pack.md) and [replay](replay.md); the rest are the knobs one by one. For DiSCo from the hub go
straight to [images](images.md) and the [DiSCo recipe](recipes/disco.md).
