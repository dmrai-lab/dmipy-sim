# The replay

Every replay is the same computation: for each walker, a phase from the sequence against the stored bands, a
weight from the tissue against the stored occupancy and contact, a phase from the field against the stored path,
and then a weighted mean over walkers. The operations on this page are that computation at different depths, from
the ensemble signal to the per-walker pieces a study reuses.

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack
from dmipy_sim.spec.tissue import Tissue

walk = d.simulate_trajectories(300, 2e-9, d.Cylinder(2e-6, (0, 0, 1)), 0.01, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/cylinder", K=8, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")
seq = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9, 1e9], TE=0.006, slew_rate=np.inf)
wm = Tissue(T2={"extra": 0.05, "intra": 0.05}, rho_2=1e-6)        # T2 for every pool of the pack's spec
```

## `replay`: the signal

```python
S = pack.replay(seq, tissue=wm)                                # (n_meas,): the ensemble mean, magnitude
Sc = pack.replay(seq, tissue=wm, complex_signal=True)          # the complex mean, for a phase-sensitive readout
print(np.round(S, 4), np.allclose(np.abs(Sc), S))
```

The knobs are `tissue`, `scanner`, `orientation` and `compartment`, each as its own page says. What `replay`
returns is the signal as measured: a b = 0 at TE with a T2 is `exp(-TE / T2)`, not 1; divide by a b = 0 of the
same setting for S/S0.

## `walker_signals`: before the mean

```python
w, ew, E = pack.walker_signals(seq, tissue=wm)                  # weights (n,), weights with the tiers applied, complex factors (n, n_meas)
print(w.shape, ew.shape, E.shape)
print(np.allclose(np.abs((ew[:, None] * E).sum(0) / w.sum()), S))   # replay is this sum
```

Any other grouping of the walkers, by the voxel they started in for a partitioned phantom, is the same sum over
its members with its own normaliser. `walker_phases` is the same without the exponential, for a consumer that
forms it where it accumulates (a GPU).

The sum above is the reduction, and both halves of it matter. `np.cos(phi).mean(0)` is **not** the signal, for
two separate reasons: it drops the `ew` weights (the relaxation and contact terms, 0.876-0.885 of `w` for the
tissue on this page), and it takes the real part where the signal is the modulus. Weight the walkers first and
what is left is the quadrature the ensemble carries, `sqrt(c^2 + s^2) - c`: zero at b = 0 and growing with the
phase spread -- 6.8e-4 and 1.1e-4 on this page's two measurements, and 3.1e-3 at b = 13,190 s/mm^2 on
`parity-fixtures/mcdc-0.2-32.0` against that pack's codec error of 4.8e-5 (dmipy-sim#484).

```python
_, ew2, phi = pack.walker_phases(seq, tissue=wm)
u = ew2 / w.sum()                                                   # the replay's own weights, not a plain mean
c = (u[:, None] * np.cos(phi)).sum(0); si = (u[:, None] * np.sin(phi)).sum(0)
print(np.allclose(np.sqrt(c ** 2 + si ** 2), S))                     # the modulus of the weighted sum IS replay
print(np.abs(c - S).round(6), np.abs(np.cos(phi).mean(0) - S).round(4))   # the quadrature, then unweighted too
```

The second number is 137 times the first: drop the weights and you are no longer measuring the reduction at all.

## `walker_primitives`: before the tissue and the scanner

The tissue and the scanner never touch the bands. What an acquisition leaves of every walker before any of them
is applied is a `Primitives`: the gradient phase, the two field scalars, the exposure per pool, the contact. Every
tissue and scanner is then arithmetic on it.

```python
prim = pack.walker_primitives(seq)
print(prim.phi.shape, prim.exposure_t2.shape, prim.contact.shape, prim.field_iso)   # no field source: no field scalars
w2, ew2, E2 = prim.signals(wm, None)
print(np.allclose(ew2, ew) and np.allclose(E2, E))                  # the same as walker_signals, the bands untouched
w3, ew3, E3 = prim.signals(wm.replace(T2={"intra": 0.08}, rho_2=2e-6), None)   # another tissue: no contraction repeated
print(np.allclose(prim.signal(wm, None), S))                        # the ensemble mean of them: replay
```

## `study`: a protocol on tissues on scanners

A `Study` names a protocol (acquisitions, each a sequence in a pose), the tissues and the scanners; its pairs are
every combination unless `pairs=` picks. On a pack it gives the signal of every pair, the primitives of each
acquisition formed once.

```python
from dmipy_sim.replay.study import Acquisition, Protocol, Study
axial = sequences.pgse([[0, 0, 1]], 0.001, 0.002, bvalues=[2e9], TE=0.005, slew_rate=np.inf)
study = Study(Protocol([seq, Acquisition(axial, name="axial")]), tissues=[None, wm, wm.replace(T2={"extra": 0.08, "intra": 0.08})], scanners=[None])
S_all = pack.study(study)                                      # (pairs, n_meas): 3 tissues x 1 scanner, 3 measurements
print(S_all.shape, np.allclose(S_all[1, :2], S))
print(study.to_meta()["pairs"][1]["tissue"])                   # the record of what was replayed
```

On a pack opened by reference, `pack.image(study)` is the same in one pass over the rows for a whole grid, with a
certified floor per volume: see [images](images.md).

## The certificate

A pack's `meta["fidelity"]` carries the codec's error and the Monte-Carlo floor of the walk over a battery of
acquisitions; a pack built on a voxel grid carries them per voxel and pool. The floor is what the walk's finite
walker count costs, the largest disagreement between the two halves of the walkers over the battery, and it is
the number a replayed signal should be read against.

```python
fid = pack.meta["fidelity"]
print(sorted(fid)[:6], fid["floor_max"] < 0.2)                 # 300 walkers: a coarse floor, as expected
```
