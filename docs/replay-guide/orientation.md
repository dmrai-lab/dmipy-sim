# The orientation

A pack is walked in its substrate's own frame. The sequence is played in the lab. The orientation is the
substrate's pose in the bore, and a replay turns the sequence into the pack's frame with it, and the field's
direction with it, so that gradient and field rotate together. A pose is a rotation, not an axis, so nothing
assumes the substrate is axially symmetric; the axis form is a convenience for substrates that are.

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack

walk = d.simulate_trajectories(300, 2e-9, d.Cylinder(2e-6, (0, 0, 1)), 0.01, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/cylinder", K=8, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")
seq = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9, 1e9], TE=0.006, slew_rate=np.inf)

along = pack.replay(seq)                                       # the cylinder along z: x is across, z is along
turned = pack.replay(seq, orientation=(1, 0, 0))               # the same cylinder with its axis along the lab's x
print(np.round(along, 3), np.round(turned, 3))                 # the two measurements swap roles
print(np.isclose(along[0], turned[1], atol=1e-6) and np.isclose(along[1], turned[0], atol=1e-6))
```

A rotation matrix is the general form:

```python
R = np.array([[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [-1, 0, 0]], float)        # z -> x
print(np.allclose(pack.replay(seq, orientation=R), turned, atol=1e-6))
```

## Poses in a study

In a [study](replay.md) the pose belongs to the acquisition, `Acquisition(sequence, orientation=R)`, because the
pose changes the contraction of the bands; two poses of one sequence are two acquisitions that share a fetch but
not a contraction, while two tissues or two scanners on one pose share both.

## Distributions of poses

A voxel is rarely one pose. `pack.pose_response(seq)` expands the pack's response over every pose in the real
Wigner basis, and a distribution of poses composes against it: a Watson or Bingham distribution, a single axis, or a
fibre orientation distribution in a named basis. That is the machinery of a composed phantom, and it is described
with the phantoms in [phantoms](phantoms.md) and in `dmipy_sim.replay.so3`.
