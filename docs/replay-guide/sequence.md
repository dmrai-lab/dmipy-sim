# The sequence

A `ScannerSequence` is what the scanner plays from t = 0 to the readout: the physical gradient `G(t)` per
measurement on a `dt` grid, the RF schedule, the readout, and the encoding per measurement. One builder per
family makes one: `pgse`, `pgste`, `ogse`, `cpmg`, `gre`, `ste`, `pte`, or `from_waveform` for a gradient array
you already have. Every builder takes the directions and either the b-values to realise or the gradient strengths
to play, the family's timing, and refuses what a scanner cannot play.

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack

walk = d.simulate_trajectories(300, 2e-9, d.Cylinder(2e-6, (0, 0, 1)), 0.01, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/cylinder", K=8, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")

seq = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9, 1e9], TE=0.006, slew_rate=np.inf)
print(seq.G.shape, seq.G_eff.shape, float(seq.dt))            # (2 measurements, n_t samples, 3), the effective gradient, the grid
print(np.round(seq.b() / 1e6))                                # the b realised, s/mm^2
```

What a replay reads from a sequence:

- **`G_eff`**, the effective gradient with the refocusing pulses folded in. Its projection onto the pack's bands
  is the gradient phase of every walker; a PGSE's 180 is a sign flip of the second lobe here. The scalar replay
  routes read this; the vector-Bloch route reads `G` and plays the pulses itself.
- **`chi_perp`**, the coherence gate: 1 while the magnetisation is transverse, 0 while it is stored longitudinally
  (a stimulated echo's mixing time). It gates the relaxation exposures and the wall contact, so a stimulated echo
  relaxes at T1 during its mixing time and at T2 elsewhere.
- **the extent**: an acquisition shorter than the walk is a prefix; nothing after its echo is read.

## Units and grids

Everything is SI: b in s/m² (`1e9` is 1000 s/mm²), times in seconds, gradients in T/m. The sequence has its own
time grid, `n_t` samples over its length; the pack has its save grid. A replay projects the sequence's exact
per-sample weights onto the pack's bridge basis, so nothing is resampled and the two grids are not each other's
concern:

```python
seq_fine = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9, 1e9], TE=0.006, n_t=4000, slew_rate=np.inf)
print(np.max(np.abs(pack.replay(seq_fine) - pack.replay(seq))) < 1e-3)   # the same signal on a four-times finer grid, to the codec's rounding
```

## What the pack's band means for a sequence

The pack keeps `K` sine bands per axis over its walk: frequencies up to `K / (2 T)`. A sequence whose gradient
content lies above that band is not reproduced, and the pack's certificate says which envelope it was certified
for. A fine `n_t` on the sequence does not add information beyond the band; it only resolves the sequence's own
ramps.

```python
print(pack.temporal_bandwidth_hz)                             # the highest frequency the bands resolve
```

Poses do not belong to the sequence. A sequence is played in the lab; the substrate's pose, [orientation](orientation.md),
turns it into the pack's frame at replay time, and an `Acquisition` in a [study](replay.md) is a sequence with a
pose attached.
