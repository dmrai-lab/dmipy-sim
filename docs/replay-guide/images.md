# Images from a pack by reference

A pack of a whole volume, DiSCo's 150 million walkers over 190 GB, is not loaded; it is opened where it is and read
by range. The columnar layout stores every channel as its own file in parts, the position bands in groups, the
field modes in groups, with a manifest of every column's bytes and an index of every voxel's rows. A consumer
plans what an acquisition needs, reads those bytes and no others, and an image is one pass over the rows.

The pages of this guide build a small layout from two shards to show the calls; the [DiSCo recipe](recipes/disco.md)
does the same on the hub.

```python
import os, tempfile
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim.io.strands import write_tck
from dmipy_sim.phantom import Grid
from dmipy_sim.replay import ReplayPack
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack
from dmipy_sim.fill.consolidate import consolidate
from dmipy_sim.spec import disco_spec, walk_spec, StratifiedByVoxel
from dmipy_sim.spec.tissue import Tissue

tmp = tempfile.mkdtemp(); os.makedirs(f"{tmp}/shards")
cls_ = [np.array([[x, 0, -12e-6], [x, 0.5e-6, 0], [x, 0, 12e-6]]) + 10e-6 for x in (-5e-6, 0, 5e-6)]   # three strands
write_tck(f"{tmp}/t.tck", cls_, coordinate_unit_m=25e-6); np.savetxt(f"{tmp}/d.txt", np.array([3e-6, 2e-6, 4e-6]) / 1e-3)
spec = disco_spec(f"{tmp}/t.tck", f"{tmp}/d.txt", side_m=20e-6)
grid = Grid(shape=(2, 2, 2), voxel_size_m=(10e-6,) * 3, origin_m=(5e-6,) * 3)
for b in (0, 1):                                                       # two blocks of the grid, one shard each
    want = np.zeros(grid.shape, np.int64); want[b] = 12
    w = walk_spec(spec, T_max=8e-4, dt_save=2e-4, seed=7 + b, require_gpu=False, field=False,
                  seeding=StratifiedByVoxel(grid=grid, walkers_per_voxel={"extra": want, "intra": want}))
    build_replay_pack(w, id=f"guide/block-{b}", license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide", K=3, voxel_grid=grid, out_path=f"{tmp}/shards/block-000{b}.p1.rpk")
manifest, index = consolidate(f"{tmp}/shards", f"{tmp}/layout", blocks=[0, 1], id="guide/columns")
print(sorted(os.listdir(f"{tmp}/layout"))[:3], index["n_rows"], "rows")
```

## Open, plan, view

```python
pack = ReplayPack.open(f"{tmp}/layout")                               # a directory here; "hf://owner/name/prefix" on the hub
seq = d.set_b(d.pgse([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], 0.2e-3, 0.5e-3, gradient_strengths=0.1, n_t=pack.meta["walk_params"]["n_t"], slew_rate=np.inf), [1e9, 1e9])
plan = pack.plan(seq, tissue=Tissue(rho=1e-6))                       # bands, modes, tiers, bytes: nothing has moved yet
print(plan["K"], plan["contact"], plan["bytes_per_row"], plan["bytes"])
view = pack.view(voxels=[(0, 0, 0)], contact=True)                    # one voxel's rows: an ordinary ReplayPack
print(view.n_walkers, np.round(view.replay(seq, tissue=Tissue(rho=1e-6)), 3))
```

`plan` decides from the manifest's variance tables how many band groups the acquisition needs to stay within a
fraction (`tol`, a quarter by default) of the pack's floor, and how many field modes at the scanner's field. `view`
reads those bands and the tiers asked for, for the voxels asked for. On the hub every byte read is a range request.

## The image loop

```python
S, floor, plan = pack.image(seq, tissue=Tissue(rho=1e-6), chunk_rows=6)
print(S.shape, floor.shape, plan["rows"])                             # (grid, n_meas): NaN where the pack has no rows
```

The loop streams row groups, prefetching the next while the current one is contracted; the host forms every
walker's phase, the device forms the exponential and the sum over each voxel's rows. Settings that share the rows
share the pass:

```python
S3, _, plan = pack.image(seq, settings=[(None, None), (Tissue(rho=1e-6), None), (Tissue(rho=2e-6), None)], chunk_rows=6)
print(S3.shape, plan["settings"])                                     # (3, grid, n_meas) from one read
```

## A study: one pass, a floor per volume

```python
from dmipy_sim.replay.study import Protocol, Study
axial = d.set_b(d.pgse([[0, 1, 0]], 0.2e-3, 0.4e-3, gradient_strengths=0.1, n_t=pack.meta["walk_params"]["n_t"], slew_rate=np.inf), [5e8])
study = Study(Protocol([seq, axial]), tissues=[None, Tissue(rho=1e-6)], scanners=[None], name="guide")
S, floor, plan = pack.image(study, chunk_rows=6)
print(S.shape, floor.shape, plan["study"]["pairs"][1]["tissue"])    # (pairs, grid, 3 measurements), a floor per pair, the record
print(np.nanmedian(floor[0]) >= 0)
```

The study's floor is measured in the same pass: each voxel's rows in two halves, the largest disagreement of the two
half-images over the measurements. It is the floor of that volume under that tissue and scanner, which is what a
consumer's error actually is.

## On the hub

```python
# docs: skip -- reads from the hub over the network
pack = ReplayPack.open("hf://SubstrateCommons/disco-replay/disco")    # 150 M walkers; zero bytes so far
print(pack.plan(seq))                                                 # what this acquisition would read: ~19 GB at 16 bands
view = pack.view(K=32, voxels=[(20, 20, 20)])                         # ~1 MB, one second
```

Reading a whole volume from the hub streams 20 to 100 GB depending on the tiers, ten to twenty-five minutes at
50 to 75 MB/s; the [DiSCo recipe](recipes/disco.md) has the measured numbers.
