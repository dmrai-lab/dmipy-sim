# Recipe: DiSCo from the hub

The DiSCo substrate, 12,196 strands in a millimetre, walked once with every tier and stored as a columnar pack on
the Hugging Face Hub (`SubstrateCommons/disco-replay`, public: no login is needed). Nothing is
downloaded whole; the pack is opened by reference and read by range.

```python
# docs: skip -- reads from the hub over the network
from dmipy_sim.replay import ReplayPack
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.replay.study import Acquisition, Protocol, Study
from dmipy_sim.spec.tissue import Tissue

pack = ReplayPack.open("hf://SubstrateCommons/disco-replay/disco")       # 150 M walkers, 31,802 voxels; zero bytes so far
seq = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]], 0.0102, 0.0167, bvalues=[1e9, 1e9], TE=0.0535)

print(pack.plan(seq))                                                    # bands, tiers, bytes: decided before any transfer
view = pack.view(K=32, voxels=[(20, 20, 20)])                            # one voxel at 32 bands, ~1 MB, a second
print(view.replay(seq))                                                  # bare diffusion, the dataset's own physics
print(view.nominal)                                                      # the spec's material: DiSCo's D, the catalogue's T2 / rho / chi

wm = lambda scanner: Tissue(T2={"intra": 0.05, "extra": 0.055, "myelin": 0.01}, rho=1.16e-6, chi_iso=-1e-7, chi_aniso=-1e-7)
study = Study(Protocol([Acquisition(seq, name="two directions")]), tissues=[None, wm], scanners=[None, 3.0, 7.0], pairs=[(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)])
S, floor, plan = pack.image(study)                                       # (3, 40, 40, 40, 2): one pass, a floor per volume
```

What the study reads is decided by its most demanding pair: the field at 7 T needs the path channel's modes and
the relaxivity needs the contact channel, and the bare pair rides along on the same rows. The measured costs of
the full 364-measurement protocol on the whole grid, from the hub:

| replay | bands | modes | bytes per row | streamed | time |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| bare diffusion | 64 | 0 | 271 | 42 GB | 16 min |
| white matter at 3 T, and at 7 T, in one pass | 64 | 32 | 679 | 105 GB | 25 min |

The pre-replayed volumes of that protocol and four others are under `disco/reference/` on the dataset, with the
plan each was read with and the comparison against the dataset's own images; the dataset card says how to use
them without any compute.

## What the replay is checked against

DiSCo published one simulated acquisition of its substrate. Replayed from the pack, the direction-mean signal of
every voxel correlates with it at 0.99 on each of the four shells, with a per-voxel r.m.s. of 0.013 against a
certified floor of 0.035; the replay is higher by one part in a hundred of S0 throughout, because the dataset's
tubes are triangle meshes inscribed in the nominal circles. Through a tractography pipeline the replayed protocol
scores 0.912 on the dataset's connectome where the dataset's own images score 0.905.
