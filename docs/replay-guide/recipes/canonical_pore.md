# Recipe: a canonical pore against its closed form

The smallest complete use of a pack: one cylinder walked once, replayed under a few knobs, and checked against
what is known in closed form. The checks are what makes the pack trustworthy for the next acquisition, the one
without a closed form.

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack
from dmipy_sim.spec.tissue import Tissue

D0, R, T = 2e-9, 2e-6, 0.02
walk = d.simulate_trajectories(2000, D0, d.Cylinder(R, (0, 0, 1)), T, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/pore", K=16, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")
```

## Along the axis the water is free

```python
seq = sequences.pgse([[0, 0, 1]] * 3, 0.002, 0.008, bvalues=[5e8, 1e9, 2e9], TE=0.012, slew_rate=np.inf)
S = pack.replay(seq)
free = np.exp(-np.array([5e8, 1e9, 2e9]) * D0)
print(np.round(S, 3), np.round(free, 3))
print(np.max(np.abs(S - free)) < 3 * pack.meta["fidelity"]["floor_max"] + 0.02)   # within the walk's floor
```

## A b = 0 with a T2 is exp(-TE / T2)

```python
b0 = sequences.pgse([[0, 0, 1]], 0.002, 0.008, bvalues=[0.0], TE=0.012, slew_rate=np.inf)
S0 = pack.replay(b0, tissue=Tissue(T2=0.05))
print(float(S0[0]), np.exp(-0.012 / 0.05), np.isclose(S0[0], np.exp(-0.012 / 0.05), rtol=1e-6))
```

## Across the axis the signal is restricted, and a longer diffusion time restricts it more

```python
short = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9], TE=0.006, slew_rate=np.inf)
long_ = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0]], 0.001, 0.015, bvalues=[1e9], TE=0.018, slew_rate=np.inf)
print(float(pack.replay(short)[0]) < float(pack.replay(long_)[0]) < 1.0)
print(float(pack.replay(long_)[0]) > np.exp(-1e9 * D0))                           # more signal than free water
```

## Surface relaxivity decays every measurement, the b = 0 included

```python
S_rho = pack.replay(seq, tissue=Tissue(rho=1e-5))
print(np.all(S_rho < S), np.round(S_rho / S, 3))                                  # one factor across b: the contact term
```

## The same walk, a shorter echo

```python
seq_te = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9], TE=0.005, slew_rate=np.inf)
print(float(pack.replay(seq_te)[0]) > 0)                                          # a 5 ms echo on a 20 ms walk: a prefix
```

None of these numbers came from a second simulation. That is the point: what was walked once answers every
question that fits in its band and its length, and the closed forms say how far to trust it.
