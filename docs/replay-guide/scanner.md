# The scanner

The scanner is the machine. In a replay today it contributes one number, the static field `B0`, and the field
enters the contraction in exactly one place: the phase every walker accumulates from the field source's
susceptibility, `B0 (chi_iso A + chi_aniso B)` with `A` and `B` the walker's gated path integrals. That is why a
scanner without a susceptibility in the tissue is refused, and why a tissue with a susceptibility does nothing
without a scanner.

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim import sequences
from dmipy_sim.acquisition.scanners import ScannerLimits
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack
from dmipy_sim.spec.tissue import Tissue

walk = d.simulate_trajectories(300, 2e-9, d.Cylinder(2e-6, (0, 0, 1)), 0.01, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/cylinder", K=8, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")
seq = sequences.pgse([[1, 0, 0]], 0.001, 0.003, bvalues=[1e9], TE=0.006, slew_rate=np.inf)

prisma = ScannerLimits.of("prisma")                             # the catalogue: field, gradient and slew limits
print(prisma.name, prisma.field_T)
print(pack.nominal_field_T)                                     # the field the pack's spec was calibrated at
```

A scanner is given as a field in tesla or as a catalogue entry; both resolve to `B0`. The cylinder pack of this
guide has no field source (its spec declares no susceptible pool), so its field is zero everywhere and a scanner
leaves the signal as it is:

```python
print(np.allclose(pack.replay(seq, tissue=Tissue(chi_iso=-1e-7), scanner=prisma), pack.replay(seq)))
```

Two things are refused instead of guessed: a field asked of a pack whose substrate declares a source but which does
not carry the path channel for it, and a field asked of a source with a tissue that has no susceptibility (the
[tissue](tissue.md) page shows the second).

A pack with a sheath carries the path channel, and there the same call at 3 T and at 7 T is the same
contraction under two scalars; a [study](replay.md) reads the rows once for both. The [DiSCo recipe](recipes/disco.md)
does exactly that.

## What the scanner is not

The scanner does not carry the tissue. The catalogue's T2 depends on the field, so "white matter at 7 T" is a
tissue looked up on a scanner, and a study takes that as a tissue that is a callable of the scanner (see
[tissue](tissue.md)). The scanner also does not carry the sequence: the sequence is what is played, the scanner
is what can play it, and a builder given a `timing=` budget refuses what the limits cannot deliver.

## Where the scanner is going

The scanner object is on its way to carrying much more than a field: a machine's sequence transforms, its
per-voxel maps, its tissue tables. Whatever it grows, the rule of this page stays: a scanner property enters a
replay as a knob on the contraction, stated once, never merged into the tissue.
