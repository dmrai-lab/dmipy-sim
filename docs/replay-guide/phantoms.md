# Phantoms: voxels from packs

A pack answers for one microstructure at any pose. A replay phantom (`.rph`, specified in
[RPH.md](https://github.com/dmrai-lab/replay-pack-spec)) is a voxel grid that cites packs, and a phantom is
replayed with the same knobs as a pack. Two ways lead to one.

**Partition** cuts one walk of a substrate larger than a voxel into the voxels its walkers started in. The grid
is free, coarsen, refine, shift, no re-walk, and every walker carries the volume it stands for, so a voxel's
signal is a weighted mean and its floor follows from the weights. The DiSCo layout of [images](images.md) is a
partition: the index maps every voxel to its rows, and `image` is the partition replayed.

**Composition** places solved packs into voxels you declare: which substrate is where, at what volume fraction, in
what pose, with what proton density. One pack serves every voxel and pose that cites it, so the file is the
arrangement rather than the physics. A composed voxel's pose is usually a distribution, and the composition
contracts the pack's pose response (see [orientation](orientation.md)) against it.

Both are a `Phantom` in `dmipy_sim.phantom`, with `Phantom.compose` and `Phantom.partition`, and both take the
same `tissue`, `scanner` and `pose` knobs as a pack. The worked examples are the reference:

- `examples/rph/circular_wm_phantom.py`: one CACTUS pack composed into an annulus with a fanned sector, swept over
  gradient and field direction.
- `examples/rph/brain_from_csd.py`: a whole brain composed from a measured fibre orientation distribution and a
  five-tissue segmentation, replayed on the subject's own scheme and written back as a DWI.

A phantom's tissue is per substrate in a composition (each cited pack has its own) and per voxel in a partition
when a map is given; without one, the pack's `nominal` or the tissue you pass applies everywhere, and, as with a
pack, nothing is applied that you did not ask for.
