# The pack

A replay pack is a walk stored once: for every walker, its positions over the walk as a bridge (the exact start
and end, and `K` sine bands between them), the pool it was in, its accumulated wall contact, and, when the substrate
has a field source, the field along its path as a few cosine modes. The pack also carries the substrate spec it was
walked from, the walk's parameters, and a certificate: the codec's error and the Monte-Carlo floor, measured over a
battery of acquisitions. Nothing in it is a signal, and not one T2, relaxivity or susceptibility value is applied
in it; those are what a replay brings.

## Making one

The guide's pages build a small pack on the CPU, a cylinder of 2 µm radius walked for 10 ms by 300 walkers; every
later page starts from it the same way.

```python
import numpy as np
import dmipy_sim as d
from dmipy_sim.replay.bank import build_replay_pack

walk = d.simulate_trajectories(300, 2e-9, d.Cylinder(2e-6, (0, 0, 1)), 0.01, 5e-4, seed=0, require_gpu=False)
pack = build_replay_pack(walk, id="guide/cylinder", K=8, license="CC-BY-4.0", citation="the guide")
print(pack.n_walkers, pack.K, pack.n_t, pack.dt)                 # 300 walkers, 8 bands, the save grid
```

`K` is the number of sine bands kept per axis: the pack's temporal band, `K / (2 T)` in hertz, which is what an
acquisition's gradient content is checked against. The walk's length `T` is the longest echo time the pack can
replay; a shorter one is a prefix.

## What it holds

```python
print(sorted(pack.arrays))                                        # the stored channels
print(pack.has_relaxation, pack.diffusivity)                     # the occupancy channel is there; the walk's D
print(round(pack.meta["fidelity"]["floor_max"], 2))                # the certificate: the Monte-Carlo floor of this walk, coarse at 300 walkers
```

- `pos_*`: the positions, as ends and bands. Bare diffusion needs only these.
- `comp_static` (or a run-length form): the pool of every walker over the walk, for T2 and T1 per pool.
- `blt_*`: the boundary local time, for surface relaxivity.
- `susc_path_*`, when the substrate has a field source: the field's channels along the path, for the sheath's
  susceptibility at a scanner's field.
- `voxel_ijk`, `voxel_certificate`, when the pack was built on a voxel grid: a floor per voxel and pool.

## The nominal tissue

The spec the pack embeds names the material it was declared with, and `pack.nominal` is that material as a
`Tissue`; `pack.nominal_field_T` is the field the spec's susceptibilities were calibrated at.

```python
print(pack.nominal)                                               # the spec's T2, T1, rho, chi; D is the walk's
print(pack.nominal_field_T)
```

A published pack therefore reproduces its paper with one call, `pack.replay(seq, tissue=pack.nominal,
scanner=pack.nominal_field_T)`, and never by default.

## Saving, loading, opening

```python
import os, tempfile
tmp = tempfile.mkdtemp()
pack.save(os.path.join(tmp, "cylinder.rpk"))
from dmipy_sim.replay import ReplayPack
same = ReplayPack.load(os.path.join(tmp, "cylinder.rpk"))
assert same.n_walkers == pack.n_walkers
```

`ReplayPack.load` reads one `.rpk` file whole. `ReplayPack.open(uri)` opens the columnar layout of a large pack
by reference, on a directory or on the Hub, and reads only the rows and bands an acquisition needs; that is the
subject of [images](images.md).
